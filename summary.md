# Overview
The intent of saving sergeant is to take images of receipts, scan them, store them in an SQL database, and then perform statistical analysis to provide insights into the user's spending habits.

# The Need
At first glance, Saving Sergeant appears to mimic the services such as Rocket Money or the built-in spending analysis your bank provides. These services analyze *whole transactions* and provide insights.

This is contrasted with Saving Sergeant, which analyzes whole transactions *and the individual items that compose each transaction*. Thus, Saving Sergeant can provide more (detailed) insights than alternative services.

A good example of this difference is grocery shopping. Rocket Money and your bank can show you how much money you spent on groceries over the last 6 months; it can't, however, tell you which items were contributing the most to your grocery cost over this time period. It also can't compare the price of the same item from different stores. Nor can it show you the cost you spent on individual items.
